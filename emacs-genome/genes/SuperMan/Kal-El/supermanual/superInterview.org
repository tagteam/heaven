* Interview with SuperMan(ager)

- S: :: SuperMan is a project which manages all your other projects.
- Y: :: This sound useful. But what exactly is considered a project?
- S: :: A project is an entry in a file, where the file-name is
  defined by the emacs variable `superman-home'. 
  An entry looks like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 **** Extensions of the Hodges-Lehmann estimator for structural equation models
     :PROPERTIES:
     :NICKNAME: HodgesLehmann
     :LOCATION: ~/research/Methods/
     :CATEGORY: Work
     :OTHERS: Terre Antivirus, Audrey Blanche
     :LastVisit: <2013-05-31 Fri 19:59>
     :END:
#+END_EXAMPLE

The properties have the following meaning:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 **** Description text
     :PROPERTIES:
     :NICKNAME: Short project name which is also used
                as directory name below LOCATION 
     :LOCATION: A directory on your computer in which
                the main project files are saved
     :CATEGORY: The project category
     :OTHERS: Names of your collaborators
              of the project
     :LastVisit: Automatically updated time-string
                 indicating when you last looked into
                 this project
     :END:
#+END_EXAMPLE	

- Y: :: Ok. How do I register my projects.
- S: :: That is easy: first open the SuperMan via M-x S RET,
        then type N for superman-new-project. You will be
        prompted for NICKNAME and CATEGORY. 
- Y: :: hmm, I will give it a try ... last question: Does the SuperMan project contain itself?
- S: :: Nice question. Probably the answer is: /Yes! But,.../. To find a better answer please read logicomix (www.logicomix.com).
